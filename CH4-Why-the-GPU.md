## Geometric primitive
In vector computer graphics, CAD systems, and geographic information systems, geometric primitive is the simplest geometric shape that the system can hadle. Points and stright line segments are some examples of geometric primitives.

## Polygon mesh
In 3D computer graphics and solid modeling, a polygon mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape of a polyhedral object. The faces usually consist of trangles, quadrilaterals or other simple convex polygons.

## GPU Rendering
GPU rendering uses a graphics card for rendering in place of a CPU, which can significantly speed up the rendering process as GPUs are primarily designed for quick image rendering.

## CPU vs GPU Rendering
The way in which data is processed by CPUs and GPUs is fundamentally similar, however where a CPU excels at handling multiple tasks, a GPU is more powerful and can handle a few specific tasks very quickly.

## Computer Graphics Pipeline
In computer graphics, a computer graphics pipeline, rendering pipeline or simple graphics pipeline, is a conceptual model that describes what steps a graphics system needs to perform to render a 3D scene to a 2D screen.

## Vector Spaces
A vector space is a mathematical structure that is defined by a given number of linearly independent vectors, also called base vector. The number of linearly independent vectors defines the size of the vector space, therefore a 3D space has three base vectors, while a 2D space would have two.

## Model Space and World Space
Models live in one specific vector space, which goes under the name of Model Space and it is represented with the canonical 3D coordinates system. Every model in a game lives in its own Model Space and if you want them to be in any spatil relation you need to transform them into a commom space which is often called World Space.

## Transformations
Moving, rotating or scaling an object it is what we call a transformation. We can see transformations in a vector space simply as a change from one space to another.
